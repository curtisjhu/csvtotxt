# csv_to_txt
Simple CLI tool to build txt files from csv

### Little tool I use to convert and clean data for Octave ML usage.
I think octave provides more intuition into how ML works at a mathematical level. I would like to use them with csv files.

### My configurations for download
```
pip install https://github.com/curtisjhu/csv_to_txt/dist/csvtotxt-0.0.1.tar.gz
```
```
csvtotxt example.csv
```


**Uninstall**
```
pip uninstall csvtotxt
```
